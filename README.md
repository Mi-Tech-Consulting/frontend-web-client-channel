# üåà Contribution guidelines
```markdown
Here is the procedure on how to work with the GitHub repo, when you want to start coding:
1. Fork the origin repo to your PERSONAL PRIVATE repo
2. Working on your new repo, (usually you wanna check out a few feature branches thus to keep the default branch easy to sync and merge from - it is a bit tricky)
3. When your code is ready to merge, pls create a PULL REQUEST from your repo to the origin repo

- branch: use `develop` branch as default
- Pls let us know if you have any questions about this procedure
```

## Getting Started

## How to Run Develop Enviorment in Local 

* copy `dev.next.config.js.sample` file to `dev.next.config.js`

Finally, run the following commands to start the development server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000.

Make sure you haven't run multiple instances for the same application at the same time.

## Authentication

### How to Use

1. Create a new user in the database using the `/auth/signup` endpoint.

2. Sign in using the `/auth/signin` endpoint.

3. You will use the `/api/auth/session` endpoint to check if a user is signed in.
   * use `useSession()` to fech the session data

4. You can also use the `/api/auth/signout` endpoint to sign out.
   * use `signOut()` to sign out

###üë©‚Äçüíª [NextAuth.js Endpoint Reference](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/pages)

* login page - `/auth/signin`
* register page - `/auth/signup`
* error page: `/auth/error`
